        <p class="text">
          Adventures can be thrilling and exciting. Nothing quite compares to the feeling of doing something that violates your comfort zone and pushes the boundaries of what is possible. In life, it is the adventures that can give you the most valuable lessons and memorable experiences.

          Like an explorer mapping out a course, the first step of your adventure lies in deciding where you want to go. It can be a new country, a different career path, or even a totally unfamiliar and alternative lifestyle. Whatever adventure you choose, the next step is deciding how you will get there. Will you take the fast and easy route, or go out of your way to seek adventure by making detours along the way?

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
          <p class="text">
            Biking is an incredible way to explore the world around us. It allows us to get up close and personal with nature, take in fresh air, and sense the direct impact of our actions on the scenery. The adventure of biking, in itself, is enough to make us appreciate the marvel of cycling.
          
          <br /> <br />
          
            Being a cyclist requires a certain level of strength, agility, and endurance, making it a great way to get in some cardio while also discovering the local area. Biking can be enjoyed in both urban and rural environments. For example, if one were to cycle in an urban setting like a city, they could learn landmarks and cultural points, take in the pace of the city, and experience a sense of community. On the other hand, an outdoor-based adventure like mountain biking can also be exhilarating.

            <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Paragliding is an inherently adventurous activity. This activity involves flying, like a bird, while suspended in a harness under a paraglider. To fly, the paraglider needs to have some kind of updraft to lift it off the ground, usually generated by heat or wind. It is possible for a person to ascend higher and higher through the updrafts, with the aim of reaching the peak experience of soaring through the sky.
          
          <br /> <br />
          
            Before taking off there are some basic safety precautions. The paraglider must inspect their equipment thoroughly and also check the weather conditions before they go out. Once they have determined their equipment is in good condition and suitable conditions, they can prepare to launch. The pilot needs to calculate their direction, speed and optimal position, before running down a steep slope to take off.

           <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Surfing is an amazing adventure sport that has taken the world by storm, which is understandable considering the thrills and excitement it provides once you’re up on your board and going with the waves. It’s also a sport that anyone aged five or ninety-five can take part in and enjoy.
          
          <br /> <br />
          
            The drive to experience new and unpredictable things and really make the best of life is what 
            continuously draws people to the water for the chance to take on the waves. With the waves comes 
            plenty of sun and a very blissful atmosphere that can put you in harmony with nature.
